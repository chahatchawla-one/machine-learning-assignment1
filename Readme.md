kNN classifier
Parzen window (hypercube and Gaussian window)
Logistic regression (binary and multi-class)
Softmax regression
Linear regression
Perceptron algorithm
Fisher's linear discriminant analysis
kmeans clustering
```

#### The metrics implemented are:
```
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 score
Number of unclassified points (for multi-class logistic regression)
ROC curve
```

#### The estimators for parameters of probability distributions are:
```
MLE (maximum likelihod estimation)
EM algorithm (expectation maximization)
```
